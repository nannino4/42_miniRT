A 42 project about coding a simple cpu-based 3D raytracing engine in C.
The program takes as argument the path to the file containing the scene to be rendered.
The program takes different flags:
  --save      saves the rendered scene as an image;
  --aa        renders the scene with anti aliasing;
  --threaded  renders the scene using multithreading;
